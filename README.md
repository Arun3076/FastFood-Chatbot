üçî FastFood Chatbot (Transformer + Gradio)

This project is a chatbot for fast-food ordering and queries, built using Transformers and fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset.
It provides an easy-to-use Gradio interface for user interaction.

‚ö° Features

Fine-tuned Transformer model for fast-food domain conversations.

Supports queries like menu items, order details, offers, and basic small talk.

Gradio-powered interface for real-time chatbot interaction.

Training notebook (Final.ipynb) contains fine-tuning process with synthetic dataset.

üöÄ How to Run

Since the fine-tuned model is very large (>100 MB), it is not uploaded to GitHub.
Instead, you can run the notebook to download and fine-tune the model automatically.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FastFood-Chatbot.git

cd FastFood-Chatbot

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook Final.ipynb


Executes training and evaluation pipeline.

Downloads a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face automatically.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Gradio App

python app.py

This will open a Gradio interface in your browser, where you can chat with the FastFood Bot.

üìå Notes

Model folder is not included because of GitHub‚Äôs 100MB limit.

The code will automatically pull the base Transformer model from Hugging Face.

For reproducibility, you can upload your fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub and load it in app.py.

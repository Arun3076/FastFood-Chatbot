### Guide to Chatting with Your Fast Food Chatbot

Welcome to the Fast Food Chatbot! Follow these simple steps to interact:

1. **Start the Conversation**: Say "Hi," "Hello," or "Hey" to begin. The chatbot will greet you and offer assistance.
   - Example: "Hi" → "Hello! I’m Fast Food Chatbot, how can I assist you?"

2. **View the Menu**: Ask for the menu with phrases like "Show me the menu" or "What’s available?"
   - Example: "What’s on the menu?" → Lists vegetarian (rice, noodles, Manchurian, $50 each) and non-vegetarian (chicken rice, chicken noodles, chicken Manchurian, $80 each).

3. **Place an Order**: Request items like "I need 2 veg noodles" or "Add 1 chicken rice."
   - Example: "Add 2 veg noodles" → "Your order of 2 veg noodles is placed with bill {bill_function} and your ID is {id}."

4. **Remove Items**: Cancel items with the order ID, e.g., "Remove 1 veg rice, ID {id}."
   - Example: "Cancel 1 chicken rice, ID {id}" → "1 chicken rice removed from order ID {id}. New bill: {bill_function}."

5. **Confirm Order**: Finalize with "Confirm order ID {id}."
   - Example: "Confirm my order ID {id}" → "Order ID {id} confirmed. Final bill: {bill_function}."

6. **Check Status**: Ask about order progress, e.g., "Status of order ID {id}?"
   - Example: "Is order ID {id} ready?" → "Order ID {id} is ready for pickup."

7. **End Conversation**: Say "Bye," "Thanks," or "Goodbye" to close.
   - Example: "Thanks, bye" → "You're welcome! Come back soon!"

8. **Unrelated Queries**: For non-food questions (e.g., "What’s the weather?"), the chatbot will redirect to food orders.
   - Example: "What’s the time?" → "Sorry, I don’t understand you. I can assist with food orders and billing."

**Tips**: Use clear phrases, include order IDs for modifications, and expect quick, food-focused responses. Enjoy your meal!
